## Display errors and warnings for a control.
## These should be displayed even if the control itself is hidden.
## Normally a hidden control will not have any errors or warnings, but if it does the application
## is likely to stop working altogether, and in that case it is nice to give some clue as to
## what is going wrong.
#if(!${supressMessages} && (${control.getErrorMessages().size()} > 0 || ${control.getWarningMessages().size()} > 0))
<div class="messages">
    #foreach( $error in ${control.getErrorMessages()} )
        #set( $errorCondition = $error )
        #parse( "investigation/error.vm" )
        #end
    #foreach( $error in ${control.getWarningMessages()} )
        #set( $errorCondition = $error )
        #parse( "investigation/warning.vm" )
        #end
